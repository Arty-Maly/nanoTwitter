# nanoTwitter


Simplified version of Twitter

Right now we have user authentication, posting of tweets, searching by text of tweets. 

Authentication is done with bcrypt.

Development database is sqlite using activeRecord

After bundle install run the program by typing:

	shotgun app.rb 
	
Shotgun gem allows live changes to be made without sinatra server restart.


There are several users created already in DB. 
passwords for two of them:
username: a
password: a

username: Crazy_Monkey
password: 123

*note before username and password there are no spaces
