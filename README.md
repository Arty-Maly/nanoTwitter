# nanoTwitter


Simplified version of Twitter

Right now we have user authentication, posting of tweets, searching by text of tweets. 

Authentication is done with bcrypt.

Development database is sqlite using activeRecord

After
 
	bundle install 

Run the program by typing:

	shotgun app.rb 

Shotgun gem allows live changes to be made without sinatra server restart.
Or you can use the classic method 

	ruby app.rb	

There are several users created already in DB. 
passwords for two of them:

	username: a
	password: a

	username: Crazy_Monkey
	password: 123

*note before username and password there are no spaces
